#Plagiarism Detector

A simple Python project to detect similarities between text files and identify potential plagiarism. This tool uses Python's built-in library to compare two text files and calculate the percentage of matching content.

#Features

->Compare any two plain text files for similarity.

->Outputs the plagiarism percentage.

->Easy to use and lightweight.

->Uses Python's difflib for efficient string comparison.

#How It Works

The script reads both files, compares their contents, and uses sequence matching to calculate a similarity ratio, which is then converted to a plagiarism percentage.

##Getting Started

[Prerequisites]
->Python 3.x installed on your machine.

[Installation]
->Clone this repository or download the files.

->Ensure your text files (e.g., demo1.txt and demo2.txt) are in the same directory as the script.

[Usage]
->Update the file names in the script if using files other than demo1.txt and demo2.txt.

#Run the script:

python plagiarism_detector.py

->The output will display the percentage of plagiarized content.

#Example

->Given two files (demo1.txt, demo2.txt) with similar content, running the script outputs:

#text

The plagiarized content is 100.00%
